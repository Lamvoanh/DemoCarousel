                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>Workers are allowed to be out in the Queensland community and contact tracing is underway. Queensland’s Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young has urged anyone in<strong> Sunnybank Hills, Calamvale and Algester</strong> to get tested if they have symptoms.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>She was infectious from January 2, and was out and about in Brisbane until January 6.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>Wednesday marked 113 days without community transmission of COVID-19 in Queensland.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>Meanwhile, NSW and Victoria have recorded astonishing coronavirus results this morning from a massive amount of tests.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>Both states have recorded zero new cases from a combined total of roughly 65,000 tests in yesterday’s reporting period.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>However, NSW recorded one new locally transmitted case that was confirmed on Thursday morning and will be officially included in Friday’s numbers. The case is a man who resides in the northern zone of the northern beaches.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>In further good news, the mystery case that sparked concern in Victoria yesterday has been linked back to the outbreak on Sydney’s northern beaches.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>Despite this, Woolworths, Dominos and Pizza Hut are among a slew of new venues in Sydney’s west that have been hit with a COVID-19 alert, with residents urged to get tested.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>The new venues of concern include the Wentworthville BWS, Domino’s Pizza, Woolworths, Green Farm Meat NSW Halal, Udaya Supermarket, Ambeys Big Apple, Sri Lakshmi Supermarket, Pizza Hut and Swagath Biryani House.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>And, thousands of people are still being urged to get tested in Melbourne due to a mystery case, who may have picked up his infection from either the MCG or stores in the Chadstone Shopping Centre.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>Infectious disease physician Allen Cheng said a 30-year-old man – whose infection can’t be linked to another case or a high risk location – attended day two of the Melbourne Test on December 27.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>He was&nbsp;<strong>not infectious when he attended</strong>, however the <strong>MCG is being investigated as a potential source for the infection</strong>.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>He also attended&nbsp;<strong>stores in the Chadstone Shopping Centre – on December 26 between 6am-2pm –&nbsp;</strong>which are being treated as potential acquisition sites for the infection.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>The stores include: Culture Kings, Huffer, JD Sports, Jay Jays, H&amp;M, Uniqlo, Myer, Superdry, Footlocker and Dumplings Plus.</p>
                <p style={{width:'100%'}}>Victoria’s coronavirus testing commander Jeroen Weimar says <strong>8000 people were in Zone 5 – where the case was seated – at the MCG, and “there’ll be many thousands of people who’ve been through Chadstone”</strong>.</p>
